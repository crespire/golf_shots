# Golf Shot Analysis

Repository for Ruby code to do shot analysis.

### Scripts available
1. `shot` - a Ruby script that takes CSV input and a club type and filters outliers via IQR method, then returns the median shot.

### Additional Scripts
Might be fun to write a max script as well, that finds the best shot after filtering outliers.
